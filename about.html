            My name is Mina and I am from capital of Iran, Tehran city. I have
            master of Electrical engineer. I got 2 masters of engineering. One
            is master of smart grid that I obtained from Tampere university in
            Finland. The other one is master of electrical power system
            management which I got from Shahid Beheshti university in Iran. I
            had several job experiences in different fields. I uses to be a
            technical engineer in Pars shar componey for several yeras. One of
            my interests is teaching so I was an english teacher for several
            years in Iran and Finland. I am professional in teaching to kids and
            teenagers. Belive me or not, I had another job in businness. I
            start-up my own instagram shop years ago and I trade Korean cosmetic
            and skin-care although this job coudnt stand after some ecenomical
            problems in my country. I had many job experiences and these days I
            am into coding.

            Although I got my university degree in electrical engineering field,
            I am starting to be a front-end developer. My enthusiasm in web
            developing start years ago when I was working in a company as a
            technical engineer. During that job, my boss ask me to give my
            opionion about company website and he asked my if I can fix them or
            not. So, I became a UX developer there. I created our website
            companey with wordpress and I was in charge of our website for
            several years. Beside my high interest in web designing, I was too
            afraid to start coding. But after a while, one of my friends
            introduce SheCodes to me and I starting to learn web-developement.
            Matt really prove that a good teacher is needed to ignite a passion
            of learning. I am really thankful. I am in my first steps as a
            front-end developer and I wish I can grow in future and build
            several websites.
